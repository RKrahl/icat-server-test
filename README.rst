icat-server-test - A test suite for ICAT and IDS servers
========================================================

This package provides a collection of tests for an `ICAT`_ and IDS
service.


System requirements
-------------------

Python:

+ Python 2.6, 2.7, or 3.1 and newer.

Required Library packages:

+ `python-icat`_

+ `pytest`_ >= 2.8

+ `distutils-pytest`_


Configuration
-------------

You need to configure an ICAT and IDS server to be tested.  To do so,
place an icat.cfg file into tests/data.  This file must have at least
the configuration sections "root", "useroffice", "acord", "ahau",
"jbotu", "jdoe", "nbour", and "rbeck" with the options and credentials
to access the test server as the respective user.  Obviously, this
implies that your authentication plugin must also have these users
configured.  An example configuration file is provided in the main
directory.

**WARNING**: the tests are destructive!  They will delete all content
from the test server and replace it with example content.  Do not
configure the tests to access a production server!


Usage
-----

Run::

     $ python setup.py test

Note that you can run the tests right out of the source directory.
You do not need to install anything from this package, in fact, there
is nothing that you could install.
